It is most often used in APIs. \n\nThis means that if you need to get real time data for a model, it could come in JSON format. \n\npandas.read_json() can make an API request and get data directly from the web.

Since Chinese and Japanese contain a much larger character set, they can't be encoded in the same way as European Languages. This leads to different standards being used.\n\nAnother reason is the country or region may use a different encoding. Europe has different standards than North America, as do other regions of the world. These differences may be arbitrary, but at the end of the day it means that pandas won't immediately recognize the file.\n\nWe also could consider that different applications and data sources use different encodings for internal reasons. If a CSV is exported from a proprietary software, they could use a different encoding with little explaination as to why.\n\nWhile there are many reasons why these different encodings are used, what is important is that we need to find out which one is used.\n\nThe easiest way to do this is to see if other people have made use of this dataset and shared their efforts online as open source. You can control-f search their code to find pd.read_csv in order to see what encoding they use. This can be done while doing preliminary explorations of the data. \n\nThe second way is to use a tool in python that can make a guess at the encodings called chardet, which is short for **character detection**","metadata":{}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":"### Good Tool to find the coding of a file : chardet\n<hr style=\"border:1px solid gray\"> </hr>\n\nThis library can be used to quickly determine what the characters in the fle are and can save a lot of time.

If the model's accuracy is unexpectedly high, then it may be a a sign that there's leakage. In this case, it is worth looking at variables with extremely high correlations.

In the future, it will be a fruitful place to look.
